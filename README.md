🌊 Water Quality Assessment Using Machine Learning in the Niger Delta
This repository contains the full codebase and data analysis workflow for the study:

"A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework for Water Quality Assessment and Contamination Clustering in the Niger Delta"

📌 Overview
This project combines Water Quality Index (WQI) analysis with supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to assess water contamination across 50 towns in Bayelsa State, Nigeria.

🔍 Key Features
WQI Computation based on WHO standards

ML Regression Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM

Classification Performance: Accuracy, AUC, F1-Score

Clustering: KMeans used for chemical profile grouping

Visualizations: Feature importance, ROC curve, spatial WQI map

📁 Files
